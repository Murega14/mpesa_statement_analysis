# Mpesa Statement Analysis

This is an analysis of an Mpesa statement from May 2022 to May 2023. The statement was generated by Safaricom and you can get yours by dialing *334#
The statement includes my transactions in the 12 months from May 2022. Columns found in the Dataset are:
    1.Receipt No.
    2.Completion Time
    3.Details
    4.Transaction Status
    5.Paid In
    6.Withdrawn
    7.Balance


I converted the statement to the .ods(This is the same as .pdf but i was using Libre Office instead of Excel because of my OS) file aand removed the password feature where a password input was needed before acessing the file.

I then converted the .ods file to a dataframe using pandas, followed by pivoting the dataframe to keep the relevant columns. After pivoting the columns that i kept were:
    1.Completion Time
    2.Details
    3.Paid In
    4.Withdrawn

I was then able to analyse the data to come up with the following insights:

<style>

.animated-figure {
  font-size: 24px;
  font-weight: bold;
  color: #333;
}

@keyframes count {
  from {
    transform: scale(1);
    opacity: 0;
  }
  to {
    transform: scale(1.1);
    opacity: 1;
  }
}

    </style>

<div class="animated-figure">
    Ksh <span id="counter">468,474.82</span>
</div>

<script>
  function animateValue(id, start, end, duration) {
    var obj = document.getElementById(id);
    var range = end - start;
    var currentTime = 0;
    var increment = 10; // Change this for smoother/faster animation
    var stepTime = Math.abs(Math.floor(duration / range));

    function updateNumber() {
      currentTime += increment;
      var val = Math.easeInOutQuad(currentTime, start, range, duration);
      obj.innerHTML = val.toLocaleString(); // Format the number with commas
      if (currentTime < duration) {
        requestAnimationFrame(updateNumber);
      }
    }

    updateNumber();
  }

  // Easing function for smoother animation
  Math.easeInOutQuad = function (t, b, c, d) {
    t /= d / 2;
    if (t < 1) return (c / 2) * t * t + b;
    t--;
    return (-c / 2) * (t * (t - 2) - 1) + b;
  };

  // Start the animation
  animateValue("counter", 100000, 100905, 2000); // Adjust duration as needed
</script>
